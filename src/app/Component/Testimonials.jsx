      text: "danhamz fantastic at helping me sell my property. I had been on the normal market with another agent with no success. When the lady came from danhamz's to discuss putting my house on the market they suggested auction as an alternative. I wasn't too sure about it at first but she reassured me that I would have a reserve so they wouldn't sell for less than what I wanted. I had lots of viewings and offers and the house sold for more than what I had set the reserve for, would definitely recommend the auction team to other people, in fact I have already passed on their details to my neighbour.",
